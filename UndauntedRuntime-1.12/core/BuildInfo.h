 * Modified work Copyright (C) 2026 MysticFox / Pranav Karande (pranav158/Mystic-Paradox)
 * Further modified in September 2026 for the Undaunted fork (Harmonicrain/Undaunted):
 * the backend address comes from the command line and requests go to the
 * Undaunted metagame over plain HTTP/WebSocket; the PlayerController
 * pre-channel guard reads ReplicateSingleActor's arguments in the executable's
 * order; the client skips the legendary-ability HUD's weapon update until a
 * weapon is equipped; the seasonal event feature flags the metagame lists are
 * forced on; world servers answer event schedule checks from the metagame's
 * seasonal event schedule; validated archive passes can be shown by the native
 * Hunt Pass selector. Not an official release of
 * Mystic Paradox or Undaunted.
